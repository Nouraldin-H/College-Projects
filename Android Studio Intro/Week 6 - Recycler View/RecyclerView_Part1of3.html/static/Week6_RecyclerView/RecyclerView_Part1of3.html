  <h1>Recycler View</h1>
    <p>Before beginning this week's module, make sure you are on your week1
      branch, and from there create a new branch called "Week6_RecyclerView".
      After, make sure you are on the new branch. If you aren't, make sure you
      checkout the new branch.</p>
    <p>Recycler View is list that can show a various number of elements, and the
      user can scroll through the elements:</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p1_1.jpg" alt="Add a RecyclerView to a fragment" style="width: 525px; height: 295.313px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>RecyclerView is relatively new to Android, and is not part of the standard
      Android classes that come with AndroidStudio. It replaces the ListView, and it offers some speed and
      memory improvements. Since RecyclerView is not part of the normal
      instation, you have to add to add the library to your <b>app/build.gradle file:</b></p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p1_2.png"></p>
    <p>In this file, find the dependencies section :</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p1_3.png"></p>
    <p>and add this line:</p>
    <p><code>implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0'</code></p>
    <p><br>
      You will notice that the line gets highlighted in yellow:</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p1_4.png"></p>
    <p>The yellow highlighting is Android Studio telling you that there's a new
      version of the recyclerview library available for download. Just hover
      your mouse over the line and click on "Change to 1.2.1" and you'll notice
      it updates 1.1.0 to 1.2.1:</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p1_5.png"></p>
    <p>Change all the other yellow lines, except the <b>junit:4.+ </b>one. Writing this using the
      + symbol means just take the latest one after 4.0.</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p1_6.png"></p>
    <p>You could change the line <code>implementation
        'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0'</code> to <code>implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.+'</code>
    and Android Studio will always take the latest version of the recyclerview library of version 1.</p>
    <p>Once you are done modifying the build.gradle file, you have to click on
      <b>"Sync now"</b> in the top right so that it downloads the new jar files from the Gradle
      repository. It's an online database of many different jar files which
      AndroidStudio will download automatically for you and link in the *.jar
      files to your project.<code></code></p>
    <p>In previous weeks, you created a new empty activity using the menu options. This
      week, you will do the same to create a class called ChatRoom. Select "File" -> "New" -> "Activity" -> "Empty Activity":

<img src="images/newChatActivity.png">


    <p>Call the new class "ChatRoom"</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p1_8.png"></p>

    <p>Go ahead and select the <b>"Launcher Activity"</b> checkbox. This will make it the Activity that gets launched
      on startup. Click Finish and then click on the&nbsp; "Add" button to add the file to the git tracking list.</p>


    <p>You should now see your new project. It uses the old setContentView() function, so modify it to use the
    new ViewBinding. The layout file name here is <b>activity_chat_room</b> so the binding class that gets generated
    should be <b>ActivityChatRoomBinding</b></p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p1_10.png"></p>
<p>
    Then look at the layout file activity_chat_room.xml and add a &lt;RecyclerView&gt; widget. Use the ConstraintView
    to constrain the RecyclerView to all 4 sides of the parent:

<img src="images/wrapContentConstraint.png">
  <p> Notice that it doesn't extend all the way to the sides? That's because it's set to "wrap_content", meaning it's the minimum size required to
  make the content fit. If you change the <b>layout_width</b> and <b>layout_height</b> to 0dp, which means <b>match_constraint,
    or drag the edges all the way to the attachment point of the constraint.</b>
  <img src="images/matchConstraintRecycler.png" >

  If we give the RecycleView an id, then we'll load it in Java using ViewBinding. Here, I've given the id named
   <b>recycleView</b> in XML, and I can access it in Java:
  <img src="images/recycleBindingJava.png"> </p>

  <p>Once your RecycleView is loaded, the only thing you have to do is call <b>setAdapter( )</b>
  <img src="images/setAdapterRecycler.png">
    What goes inside the parentheses is <b>new RecyclerView.Adapter()</b>
    <img src="images/adapterMissingFunctions.png">


    Next, we'll create an inner class inside ChatRoom called <b>MyRowHolder</b> which will be an object for representing everything that goes
    on a row in the list. Create an inner class in your ChatRoom.java class like this:
    <pre>
    class MyRowHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        public MyRowHolder(@NonNull View itemView) {
            super(itemView);
        }
    } </pre><p> For now, we'll just leave it empty but this class is what goes inside the generics < > in the Adapter :

      <pre>
      binding.recycleView.setAdapter(new RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;MyRowHolder&gt;() )
    </pre>


<p>    If you hover your mouse over the red lines, you get a messages saying that Adapter can't be instantiated
    because it's missing functions.
    <img src="images/implementMethods.png">
    Click on the "Implement methods" link and then select "Ok" to generate the missing methods and you'll see this:
<img src="images/compilerImplementedMethods.png">

    A RecyclerView.Adapter object needs 3 functions to tell the view how to draw items in the list.
    Those functions are:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) </b> - This function creates a ViewHolder object which we'll learn next. It
      represents a single row in the list</li>
      <li><b>onBindViewHolder(MyRowHolder holder, int position) </b> - This initializes a ViewHolder to go at the row specified by the position parameter.</li>
      <li><b>getItemCount()</b> - This function just returns an int specifying how many items to draw.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    <p>
      Continue on to the next module to learn what to put in these functions.
    </p>
