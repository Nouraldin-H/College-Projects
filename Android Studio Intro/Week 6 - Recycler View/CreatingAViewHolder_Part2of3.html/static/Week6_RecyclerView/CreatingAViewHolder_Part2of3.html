  <h1>Configuring the Adapter functions</h1>
    <p>The next step is to decide how to design a row in the list. We want to
      show a text message, and the time it was sent, and normally a conversation
      will have message that you send on one side, and messages that the other
      person sent will be on the other side:</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p2_1.png"></p>
    <p>So now we have to decide how to show this. Should the message and time be
      on the same line? Or should the time be above the message as shown in the
      picture above? You need to create a layout file where can test out which
      looks better. Right-click on the res/layout folder and select "New" -&gt;
      "Layout Resource File".</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p2_2.png"></p>
    <p>Call this new file "sent_message". You can't use capital letters or
      spaces in the file name. The root tag will be a ConstraintLayout.</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p2_3.png"></p>
    <p>Drag two TextViews on the screen:</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p2_4.png"></p>
    <p>One TextView will be for the message. Move one TextView to the top left
      corner, and constrain it to the top and left side of the parent. Set the
      text to be "Message goes here" just so you know that is where the text
      will go later. We'll replace the String later in the code. Give it the id
      of "@+id/message". Take the other TextView, and constrain it to the bottom
      of the other TextView, but this time constrained to the opposite edge of
      the screen. Give it the text "Time goes here". You'll replace that string
      later in code as well. Give it the id of "@+id/time":</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p2_5.png"></p>
    <p>Remember now that our rows have two TextViews that we want to change in code. Go back to your MyRowHolder class and declare two variables
      to load them in code. The whole point of the MyRowHolder class is to maintain variables for what you want to set
    on each row in your list.</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p2_8.png"></p>
    <p>The view that is passed in as a parameter represents the ConstraintLayout
      that is the root of the row. This view has the two TextViews as sub-items
      so you have to find them by id, like you would normally do for an Activity
      in the onCreate function. Modify your constructor:</p>
    <p><img src="images/img_p2_9.png"></p>
    <p>This time make sure that you are calling findViewById from the itemView
      parameter.</p>

    <p>Now let's implement the onCreateViewHolder function. This is responsible
      for creating a layout for a row, and setting the TextViews in code. You
      can use ViewBinding to load your views class to load a layout, however the onCreateViewHolder has
      an <b>int viewType</b> parameter to tell what kind of viewType you should be loading. By default, it is 0
      but there is a getViewTypeForPosition() function where you can change what viewType gets passed in for a
      given row position.
      For now, just implement normal ViewBinding loading:
      <img src="images/viewBindingLoading.png">
      all the onCreateViewHolder() needs to do is to load the correct View for the type <b>viewType</b>. We'll learn how to modify
      that in a little bit.
    </p>
<hr>

<h2>onBindViewHolder</h2>
<p>The funcion onBindViewHolder is where you set the objects in your layout for the row. Right now, your MyRowHolder class
  has two TextView objects. The onBindViewHolder() function is meant to set the data for your ViewHolder
  object that will go at row <b>position</b> in the list:

  <pre>
    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull MyRowHolder holder, int position){
      holder.messageText.setText("");
      holder.timeText.setText("");
    }</pre>

</p>

    <p>At this point, we need some data that will be shown in the list. We can add an ArrayList of String objects that
      will each go on a separate row in the list. Above the onCreate() function, declare an class variable:
  <pre>
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; messages = new ArrayList<>();</pre>



      <p>Now in the onBindViewHolder function, we can retrieve the object that goes in row "position" in this list:
    <pre>
    String obj = messages.get(position);</pre>
    <p>Now we'll set the messageText in onBindViewHolder:
    <pre>
      holder.messageText.setText(obj);</pre></p>


    <hr>
<h2>int getItemCount()</h2>
    <p>The getItemCount function should just return the number of rows in the list, and since we want to show
    whatever is in our ArrayList, the number of rows will be just the size of the list:
    <pre>
    return messages.size();</pre></p>
    <hr>
    <h2>int getItemViewType(int position)</h2></h2>
    <p>There is another function called getItemViewType(int position). This function returns an int
    which is the parameter which gets passed in to the <br><b>onCreateViewHolder(</b>ViewGroup parent, <b>int viewType</b>) function</p>
If you want to load different layouts for different rows, this function lets you return an int to indicate
    which layout to load. For now, we are just loading one layout, so you can just return 0 for this function:
    <pre>
      getItemViewType(int position){
        return 0;
      }
    </pre>
<hr>
    <h2>Testing by adding data</h2>


    <p>We will need to add data to our messages ArrayList, so let's add an EditText to the bottom of the layout:
<img src="images/sendLayout.png"/>

    </p>
    <p>Now all that's left to do is to add a click listener to the button in onCreate:
    <img src="images/addingClickListener.png"> </p>
    <p>Go ahead and try that now. If you type some text into the EditText and click the button, it
    should clear the EditText, and add the string to the messages ArrayList. However, the RecyclerView
    doesn't show the new element. That's because whenever the ArrayList changes, you have to notify the
    Adapter object that something has been inserted, or deleted. For this, the Adapter class has a
    <b>notifyItemInserted(int position)</b> function, which tells the Adapter which row has to be redrawn.
    Since you're adding to the back of the ArrayList, the row that needs updating is <b>messages.size()-1</b>
    <img src="images/notifyItemInserted.png"> </p>
    <p>The myAdapter variable above should be a class variable declared outside of the onCreate function:<br>
    <pre>
          private RecyclerView.Adapter<MyRowHolder> myAdapter;
    </pre><br>
    <p>Then to initialize the variable, simply add it to the line where you call <b>new RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;MyRowHolder&gt;</b>
<img src="images/addMyAdapter.png"><br>
    Now whenever you add items to the ArrayList, you must call <b>notifyItemInserted(int position);</b><br>
    Whenever you remove something from the list, you must call <b>notifyItemRemoved(int position);</b> and the adapter
    will remove that single row.

    Whenever your entire ArrayList has changed (like loading from a database), then you call <b>notifyDatasetChanged()</b></p>
<hr>
    <h2>LayoutManager
    </h2>
    <p>The RecyclerView supports 1 or more columns for showing data, and you can either scroll
      in a Vertical or Horizontal direction through the items.
      To specify a single column scrolling in a Vertical direction, you call:
      <pre>
      binding.recycleView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this)); </pre>
<p>If you try it now, you should be seeing messages being added one at a time every time you click the "Send" button. The EditText
  field is being cleared so that you can write a new message.
    </p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Surviving Rotation Changes</h2>
  <p>If the app is working and you've added some messages, go ahead and add some messages. Then rotate your
  emulator / device by 90degrees. Whenever Android has a rotation change, it finishes the current activity and then starts a brand new Activity
  in the new orientation. This means that the previous activity gets removed and new one goes through the process of calling:
  <ol>
      <li>onCreate</li>
      <li>onStart</li>
      <li>onResume</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    It also means that a new ArrayList gets allocated with all the previous elements deleted. You don't want
    all of your messages removed whenever the user rotates the device, so we'll use a ViewModel class here to make the data
    survive the rotation change. In the data package, create a <b>ChatRoomViewModel</b> that extends ViewModel.
    Here we want the whole ArrayList to survive, so we'll declare a <b>MutableLiveData&lt; ArrayList&lt;String&gt; &gt;</b><br>
    <pre>
    public class ChatRoomViewModel extends ViewModel {
      public MutableLiveData&lt;ArrayList&lt;String&gt;&gt; messages = new MutableLiveData< >();
    }</pre>

    <br><p>
    Then in ChatRoom.java, change the ArrayList&lt;String&gt; to:
    <pre>
          ChatRoomViewModel chatModel ; </pre>
    <br><p>
    then initialize the onCreate function:
    <pre>  chatModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(ChatRoomViewModel.class);</pre><br>
    <p> and next retrieve the ArrayList<> that it is storing:
      <pre>messages = chatModel.messages.getValue();</pre><p>
      Then verify if the chatModel.messages variable has never been set before. The first time you come to the ChatRoom class
    you will have to initialize the ChatModel class:
    <pre>
      if(messages == null)
      {
        chatModel.messages.postValue( messages = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt>();
      }
    </pre><p> This way, the ViewModel will keep a version of your ArrayList of data so that it survives orientation changes of your app.
      Go ahead and try it now. Add some messages to your list, and rotate the phone a few times. The ArrayList
      should not be reset at any time.
