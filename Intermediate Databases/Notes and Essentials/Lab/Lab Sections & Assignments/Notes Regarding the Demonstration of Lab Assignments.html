<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000;">When accessing the Database Assignments section in Brightspace, you will notice that for every week there is a different lab assignment (consisting of multiple screen shots) that must be submitted, completely and correctly to obtain a grade mark. As noted, each weekly lab assignment is worth either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5% of your total mark (part marks are permissible).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000;">Additionally, students are allowed to submit later lab assignments prior to the week they are due. Any number of &ldquo;future&rdquo; lab assignments can be submitted.</span></p>
